# Type of dataset: Image Dataset: Binary classification
# path = kagglehub.dataset_download("anthonytherrien/dog-vs-cat") #
# I also forked the anthonytherrien/dog-vs-cat repository from KaggleHub to my own repository. #
# Methods (Not beginning from scratch): 
    # 1. Sequential model in Keras, which is a linear stack of three fully connected (Dense) layers suitable for a feedforward neural network.
    # 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    # 3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Customize the code with your own Kaggle account information:
# Set Kaggle API credentials as environment variables.
    # os.environ['KAGGLE_USERNAME'] = 'deardear123456'
    # os.environ['KAGGLE_KEY'] = '78e765f9a66ed233a108a1c33bed73d7'
# Modify all file paths to match your own setup
